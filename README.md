```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nobuti/react-validation.git <my-project-name>

```

## Running the Project

After completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn (or npm) <script>`    |Description|
|----------------------------|-----------|
|`start`                     |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|
|`build`                     |Builds the application to ./dist|
|`test`                      |Runs unit tests with Jest.|
